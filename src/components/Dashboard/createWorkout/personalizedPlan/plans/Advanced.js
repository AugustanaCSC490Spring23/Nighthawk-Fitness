The grip should be slightly wider than hip-width (can vary), with the palms facing away from the body. This is something so few lifters do, and as a result, they flare their elbows out and leave a rep (or two) in the tank. the chest collapsing, and the biceps lacking width and fullness. Squeezing the bar will activate all of the muscles in your forearms and upper arm, which will generally activate the target muscles more. Also, you’ll be tight and less prone to flaring your arms out or performing generally sloppy reps. Instead of dragging the bar up the body, think about keeping the elbows slightly in front of the body at all times. Imagine yourself curling from a side view — your elbows should travel slightly in front of your torso. Continue to curl up, focusing on not letting the shoulders come forwards. Your shoulders will slightly — slightly! — come into to play when your elbows drift forward. Remember to primarily curl with your biceps. The point of letting your elbows come forward a bit is to further isolate the biceps. Curl the bar until it’s about an inch or two from the front of your shoulders. This is just a suggestion. Really, curl until you feel your biceps contract the most. Find that spot, hold the weight there for a beat, and then find that spot again on your next rep. The goal here is about gaining a contraction.',

The grip should be slightly wider than hip-width (can vary), with the palms facing away from the body. This is something so few lifters do, and as a result, they flare their elbows out and leave a rep (or two) in the tank. the chest collapsing, and the biceps lacking width and fullness. Squeezing the bar will activate all of the muscles in your forearms and upper arm, which will generally activate the target muscles more. Also, you’ll be tight and less prone to flaring your arms out or performing generally sloppy reps. Instead of dragging the bar up the body, think about keeping the elbows slightly in front of the body at all times. Imagine yourself curling from a side view — your elbows should travel slightly in front of your torso. Continue to curl up, focusing on not letting the shoulders come forwards. Your shoulders will slightly — slightly! — come into to play when your elbows drift forward. Remember to primarily curl with your biceps. The point of letting your elbows come forward a bit is to further isolate the biceps. Curl the bar until it’s about an inch or two from the front of your shoulders. This is just a suggestion. Really, curl until you feel your biceps contract the most. Find that spot, hold the weight there for a beat, and then find that spot again on your next rep. The goal here is about gaining a contraction.',

This is something so few lifters do, and as a result, they flare their elbows out and leave a rep (or two) in the tank. the chest collapsing, and the biceps lacking width and fullness. Squeezing the bar will activate all of the muscles in your forearms and upper arm, which will generally activate the target muscles more. Also, you’ll be tight and less prone to flaring your arms out or performing generally sloppy reps. Instead of dragging the bar up the body, think about keeping the elbows slightly in front of the body at all times. Imagine yourself curling from a side view — your elbows should travel slightly in front of your torso. Continue to curl up, focusing on not letting the shoulders come forwards. Your shoulders will slightly — slightly! — come into to play when your elbows drift forward. Remember to primarily curl with your biceps. The point of letting your elbows come forward a bit is to further isolate the biceps. Curl the bar until it’s about an inch or two from the front of your shoulders. This is just a suggestion. Really, curl until you feel your biceps contract the most. Find that spot, hold the weight there for a beat, and then find that spot again on your next rep. The goal here is about gaining a contraction.',

The grip should be slightly wider than hip-width (can vary), with the palms facing away from the body. This is something so few lifters do, and as a result, they flare their elbows out and leave a rep (or two) in the tank. the chest collapsing, and the biceps lacking width and fullness. Squeezing the bar will activate all of the muscles in your forearms and upper arm, which will generally activate the target muscles more. Also, you’ll be tight and less prone to flaring your arms out or performing generally sloppy reps. Instead of dragging the bar up the body, think about keeping the elbows slightly in front of the body at all times. Imagine yourself curling from a side view — your elbows should travel slightly in front of your torso. Continue to curl up, focusing on not letting the shoulders come forwards. Your shoulders will slightly — slightly! — come into to play when your elbows drift forward. Remember to primarily curl with your biceps. The point of letting your elbows come forward a bit is to further isolate the biceps. Curl the bar until it’s about an inch or two from the front of your shoulders. This is just a suggestion. Really, curl until you feel your biceps contract the most. Find that spot, hold the weight there for a beat, and then find that spot again on your next rep. The goal here is about gaining a contraction.',

Squeezing the bar will activate all of the muscles in your forearms and upper arm, which will generally activate the target muscles more. Also, you’ll be tight and less prone to flaring your arms out or performing generally sloppy reps. Instead of dragging the bar up the body, think about keeping the elbows slightly in front of the body at all times. Imagine yourself curling from a side view — your elbows should travel slightly in front of your torso. Continue to curl up, focusing on not letting the shoulders come forwards. Your shoulders will slightly — slightly! — come into to play when your elbows drift forward. Remember to primarily curl with your biceps. The point of letting your elbows come forward a bit is to further isolate the biceps. Curl the bar until it’s about an inch or two from the front of your shoulders. This is just a suggestion. Really, curl until you feel your biceps contract the most. Find that spot, hold the weight there for a beat, and then find that spot again on your next rep. The goal here is about gaining a contraction.',

Keep folding forward until your fingers reach the kettlebell handle, then grab the handle by wrapping your fingers around it. Complete the movement by pulling the weight with the muscles of the backside of your body—the hamstrings and butt muscles. Complete the movement with your body upright and the support leg fully extended.

Inhale, then exhale. Lift your feet up from the floor or box so that you’re hanging from the bar, and engage your core by pulling your belly button in toward your spine. Pull your shoulders back and down. Engaging the muscles in your arms and back, bend your elbows and raise your upper body up toward the bar until your chin is over the bar. You can imagine bringing your elbows toward your hips if that makes the movement easier. As you move, avoid swinging your legs around or shrugging your shoulders up.

Keep folding forward until your fingers reach the kettlebell handle, then grab the handle by wrapping your fingers around it. Complete the movement by pulling the weight with the muscles of the backside of your body—the hamstrings and butt muscles. Complete the movement with your body upright and the support leg fully extended.

Keep the support (balancing) leg straight or allow a slight, gentle bend to the knee. Keep folding forward until your fingers reach the kettlebell handle, then grab the handle by wrapping your fingers around it. Complete the movement by pulling the weight with the muscles of the backside of your body—the hamstrings and butt muscles. Complete the movement with your body upright and the support leg fully extended. Make sure to finish the full range of motion by pushing your hips forward at the top of the movement, so that your butt muscles are firm.

Be careful not to raise the hips first so the trunk moves forward and the back becomes rounded. Don’t try to haul the bar up with your arms. The arms stay extended under tension while gripping the bar as the legs push up. Think of the legs and shoulders moving upward in unison with the hips, the balancing point. The bar should almost graze the shins and rest around thigh level as you reach full height. Pull the shoulders back as much as possible without bending backward.

The grip should be slightly wider than hip-width (can vary), with the palms facing away from the body. This is something so few lifters do, and as a result, they flare their elbows out and leave a rep (or two) in the tank. the chest collapsing, and the biceps lacking width and fullness. Squeezing the bar will activate all of the muscles in your forearms and upper arm, which will generally activate the target muscles more. Also, you’ll be tight and less prone to flaring your arms out or performing generally sloppy reps. Instead of dragging the bar up the body, think about keeping the elbows slightly in front of the body at all times. Imagine yourself curling from a side view — your elbows should travel slightly in front of your torso. Continue to curl up, focusing on not letting the shoulders come forwards. Your shoulders will slightly — slightly! — come into to play when your elbows drift forward. Remember to primarily curl with your biceps. The point of letting your elbows come forward a bit is to further isolate the biceps. Curl the bar until it’s about an inch or two from the front of your shoulders. This is just a suggestion. Really, curl until you feel your biceps contract the most. Find that spot, hold the weight there for a beat, and then find that spot again on your next rep. The goal here is about gaining a contraction.',

Maintain a neutral spine position. Stabilize the abdominal muscles by bracing them. Squat down, bending at the knees. The form for descending to the bar is similar (but not identical) to the squat, with your back straight or arched slightly and not rounded at the shoulders or spine. Grasp the bar just outside the line of the knees with an overhand or mixed grip. Lift the bar by pushing upward with the legs from the knees. Breathe out on exertion. Be careful not to raise the hips first so the trunk moves forward and the back becomes rounded. Don’t try to haul the bar up with your arms. The arms stay extended under tension while gripping the bar as the legs push up. Think of the legs and shoulders moving upward in unison with the hips, the balancing point. The bar should almost graze the shins and rest around thigh level as you reach full height. Pull the shoulders back as much as possible without bending backward. Lower the bar to the floor with a reverse motion ensuring a straight back.',

Pull your shoulders back and down. Engaging the muscles in your arms and back, bend your elbows and raise your upper body up toward the bar until your chin is over the bar.

The form for descending to the bar is similar (but not identical) to the squat, with your back straight or arched slightly and not rounded at the shoulders or spine. Grasp the bar just outside the line of the knees with an overhand or mixed grip. Lift the bar by pushing upward with the legs from the knees. Breathe out on exertion. Be careful not to raise the hips first so the trunk moves forward and the back becomes rounded. Don’t try to haul the bar up with your arms. The arms stay extended under tension while gripping the bar as the legs push up. Think of the legs and shoulders moving upward in unison with the hips, the balancing point. The bar should almost graze the shins and rest around thigh level as you reach full height. Pull the shoulders back as much as possible without bending backward. Lower the bar to the floor with a reverse motion ensuring a straight back.',

Inhale, then exhale. Lift your feet up from the floor or box so that you’re hanging from the bar, and engage your core by pulling your belly button in toward your spine. Pull your shoulders back and down. Engaging the muscles in your arms and back, bend your elbows and raise your upper body up toward the bar until your chin is over the bar. You can imagine bringing your elbows toward your hips if that makes the movement easier. As you move, avoid swinging your legs around or shrugging your shoulders up.

The grip should be slightly wider than hip-width (can vary), with the palms facing away from the body. This is something so few lifters do, and as a result, they flare their elbows out and leave a rep (or two) in the tank. the chest collapsing, and the biceps lacking width and fullness. Squeezing the bar will activate all of the muscles in your forearms and upper arm, which will generally activate the target muscles more. Also, you’ll be tight and less prone to flaring your arms out or performing generally sloppy reps. Instead of dragging the bar up the body, think about keeping the elbows slightly in front of the body at all times. Imagine yourself curling from a side view — your elbows should travel slightly in front of your torso. Continue to curl up, focusing on not letting the shoulders come forwards. Your shoulders will slightly — slightly! — come into to play when your elbows drift forward. Remember to primarily curl with your biceps. The point of letting your elbows come forward a bit is to further isolate the biceps. Curl the bar until it’s about an inch or two from the front of your shoulders. This is just a suggestion. Really, curl until you feel your biceps contract the most. Find that spot, hold the weight there for a beat, and then find that spot again on your next rep. The goal here is about gaining a contraction.',
