You will want to start off with two 10-pound plates, as this is likely enough for a first time doing this exercise. You will squeeze them together using your palms. You can have more plates but this will make the exercise harder to do, even if the weight comes out the same as it will challenge your ability to grip. Bring the plates to the middle of your chest. Next, you will want to bring the plates to the middle of your chest while your fingertips are pointing away from your body, pressing your palms together as hard as you can against the plates. Retract your shoulder blades and keep your chest up. You need to make sure that your shoulder blades are properly retracted and that your (upper) back is not. Your chest must be up so that you are properly and fully isolating your chest muscles and not accidentally using other muscle groups such as your lats or your shoulders. Extend your arms forward and slightly upward. Before you do this step, you need to make sure that you are pressing your hands together against the plates as hard as you possibly can. Then, you will want to extend your arms forward - at this point, you will feel your chest working very hard, and you will want to use a controlled tempo to keep bringing your arms both up and forward. You need to make sure that you are going both forward and up, as going forward and down will be easier, but it will not work out your pec muscles nearly as much. Contract your chest as hard as possible. At no point during this exercise should you relax your muscles. The point of the plate pinch press is that you will have your pec muscles contracted at every turn so that your core is properly exercised. Make sure you are contracting and squeezing as hard as you can for the full duration of the movement. Also, make sure that your spine is in a neutral setting so that you are only working out your pecs and not something else. Reverse your arms in the exact same movement pattern  Once your arms have been extended fully, you may start bringing the plates back to the starting position. Make sure you are not dropping your arms low, and that you are always contracting your chest muscles so that you can keep the concentration in your core.',

Breathe in deep and engage the muscles of your abdomen, taking care to keep your head aligned with your spine as you slowly bend forward.
