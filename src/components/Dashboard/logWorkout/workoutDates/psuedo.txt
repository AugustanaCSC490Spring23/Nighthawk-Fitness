           userData.allWorkouts : An Array of every wrkout object. 

           1. Go through allWorkouts arrayOfWorkouts

           2. Set condition: Log date of first workout entry

           3. Contine to traverse the array until the workout date changes

           4. Append all of the workouts with the same date to an array

           5. Map through these workouts and put them into a "day" css container that will hold all workouts for that day

           6. After looping through this array, clear it. Then, continue through the all workouts array. You stop every time the date changes
           and then empty the array into a new day catagory that contains all of the workouts for that day

    const [dateState, setDate] = useState()

    const [arrDates, setArr] = useState([])

    allWorkouts.map (workout) = >
        if (workout.date == dateState){
            setArr(...arrDates, workout.date)
        } else{
            arrDates.map{
                (logic to put all these workouts into a day css container)}
                setArr[workout.date]
                setDate[workout.date]
            }
